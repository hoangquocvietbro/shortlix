00:00,000|00:17,400|Boss, the elf, keep her for me. Just wait for me. He grabbed Cassandra by the neck and lifted her up. It seemed that the Goblin’s bodily fluids had a special paralyzing and stimulating effect on females. In this way, the chances of winning against the matriarchal elf poison were even higher.
00:17,400|00:26,367|Cassandra gritted her teeth, her whole body trembling as she cursed. You lowly creatures, you dare to kidnap this princess and even plot to attack the Elf tribe.
00:26,367|00:36,767|If it weren't for my mother's kindness, your kind would have been wiped out by the Elf tribe long ago. If you dare touch a hair on my head, my mother will not spare you.
00:36,767|01:15,767|Lam Thien gave a wicked smile. Ha, kindness? How interesting. He then threw Cassandra to the ground.  The elves in your mouth and the elves in our tribe don't seem to be quite the same.  Although my tribe is stupid, they wouldn’t say that… Obviously, elves could wipe out all the Goblins in the forest, but there are still many Goblins living in the forest. It's not just because of kindness, is it? In the end, there’s no need to say more, tonight I will take the tribe to investigate. Then he turned to the other Goblins.  You guys, take the bodies of the other two dead elves and share them, devour their energy.  Cassandra was terrified. What?
01:15,767|01:19,200|He looked at Cassandra and continued, And as for you.
01:19,200|01:23,867|Seeing this, Cassandra started to tremble in fear. No, don't, don't.
01:23,86Old eighth actually dared to take action against the old demon,

 Lu Zhou!

 Just now,

 Lu Zhou,

 having fully condensed the Eight Methods Unobstructed Avatar,

 slowly opened his eyes.

 Due to the long condensation time,

 his legs had gone numb,

 causing him to stagger and fall to the ground.

 This time,

 apart from the duration being longer,

 there was no difference from before; there were no bottlenecks,

 nor were there any issues with the dragging process.

 The mobilization of Primal Energy and the condensation of the Avatar were exceptionally precise.

Lu Zhou checked his cultivation level and indeed,

 he had advanced to the Divine Court Realm,

 the realm of Governing the Way,

 just a step away from the Way of Transformation.

 At this realm,

 one could easily control one’s own path of cultivation.

 In the Great Flame world,

 each person's path of cultivation begins to take shape in the early stages of the Divine Court Realm: paths of the knife,

 sword,

 and so on.

 Many Cultivators often set the direction of their cultivation early on,

 but it truly takes shape in this realm of the Divine Court Realm.

 At the Governing the Way stage,

 the foundations laid in the previous paths of cultivation are also manifested in the weapons,

 which is why heavenly weapons are so precious.

Lu Zhou nodded in satisfaction,

 sensing the state of the extraordinary power of the Heavenly Writing,

 which was about one-third of its saturated state,

 still quite decent.

 Governing the Way in the Divine Court Realm,

 this speed was truly unparalleled.

 He pushed open the window to stretch his body but embarrassingly found that the outside was already crowded with people.

“How bold!

” A light shout mixed with a trace of Primal Energy rolled out from the east pavilion.

 Ming Shiyin and Hua Wudao,

 among others,

 took several steps back,

 all shouting,

 “Master,

 Pavilion Lord!

“Are you all so idle?

“I dare not,

” Ming Shiyin quickly bowed and said,

 “Master,

 I went to find Jiang Aijian.

 He said the box you asked him to investigate was not in the palace.

 As for the things of the Evil Sky Pavilion,

 he needs to investigate carefully.

 he suspects that Si Wuya is investigating him,

 so he will not contact the Evil Sky Pavilion for the time being.

“That rebellious disciple again,

 even the Body-Binding Divine Spell's punishment can’t make him behave.

 Jiang Aijian also said that he heard about the Lotus Platform affair,

 and the expert who fought with the master likely came from the Loulan masters of Western Frontier.

“Loulan masters?

 Are they very powerful?

” Little Yuan'er asked,

 puzzled.

Ming Shiyin explained,

 “Back when Loulan went to war with Great Flame,

 it brought devastation,

 countless people were displaced,

 and the cause of this was the witchcraft Cultivators of Loulan.

 Despite this,

 Loulan was defeated.

 Since then,

 Great Flame Cultivators no longer underestimate witchcraft.

Duan Musheng was somewhat surprised: "Does Great Flame not have any powerful practitioners of witchcraft?

Hua Wudao replied,

 "Witchcraft itself originated from Great Flame,

 but its weaknesses are too obvious,

 and there are few practitioners; only some Cultivators who are devoted to witchcraft still persist.

Ming Shiyin bowed to Lu Zhou and reminded him,

 "Master,

 this information should be reliable.

 The ability to control such a large amount of witchcraft on the Lotus Platform should not be underestimated.

The being they encountered at the energy nexus on the Lotus Platform was not human but some kind of fierce beast.

 Thus,

 the opponent is likely the master of this beast.

Lu Zhou nodded: "Did your trip to the Divine Capital expose any of your movements?

Ming Shiyin confidently answered,

 "Absolutely not.

 Old Seventh is indeed clever,

 but he wouldn't possibly have someone watch me even when I go to the toilet,

"That's a valid point,

 but the analogy is too crude.

 Moreover,

 with Ming Shiyin's skills,

 hiding his movements is not difficult.

As Lu Zhou was pondering,

 a sudden loud noise came from afar.

 Everyone looked in the direction of the sound and saw that it came from the location of the Reflection Cave on the back mountain.

 At this moment,

 Zhou Jifeng ran from the back mountain and kneeled before Lu Zhou,

 anxiously saying,

 "Pavilion Lord,

 something has happened to Mr.

 Eight!

Lu Zhou said nothing,

 leaped down from the pavilion,

 and headed towards the back mountain.

 Ming Shiyin followed and muttered,

 "Old eighth,

 this fool,

 can't he ever keep quiet?

Zhou Jifeng said anxiously,

 "Mr.

 Eight has lost the Precious Zen Robe.

A moment later,

 everyone arrived at the entrance of Reflection Cave.

 Pan Zhong was standing at the entrance,

 looking bewildered,

 and muttering,

 "This is impossible!

 Absolutely impossible!

Ming Shiyin stepped forward to ask,

 "What's impossible?

Pan Zhong felt his confidence severely shaken,

 his face filled with disbelief: "I personally bound Mr.

 Eight's cultivation with my techniques,

 how could it be undone?

 Could it be that I didn't go deep enough?

 Hua Wudao looked at the barrier at the cave's entrance and said,

 "This Forceful Energy chaos results from forcibly practicing the cultivation technique; it needs to be suppressed quickly.

 Forceful Energy chaos often occurs because of practicing an incomplete technique.

 In an attempt to raise their realm,

 practitioners might supplement the missing parts of the technique themselves.

 If the person is a genius at creating techniques,

 it can have a good effect,

 but otherwise.

 this is what happens.

Lu Zhou shook his head and said,

 "Why bring suffering upon oneself unnecessarily?

" After saying this,

 he strode into the cave.

 Inside,

 Zhu Honghong looked up and saw,

 "Master?

" His eyes were bloodshot,

 seemingly losing his sanity.

He raised his palm,

 about to unleash a Nine Tribulations Thunderous Energy strike,

 but before he could rush forward,

 he suddenly shuddered with fear and quickly reversed his palm strike towards his own chest.

 The Forceful Energy recoiled,

 sending him flying several meters backward,

 crashing to the ground.

 Zhu Honghong let out a painful scream,

 rolling on the ground.

Lu Zhou looked on calmly and said,

 "At least you know who your master is,

 preferring to hurt yourself rather than harm your master.

" After saying this,

 he picked up his palm,

 and a golden Forceful Energy mark flew out.

 This gentle Forceful Energy mark hit Zhu Honghong's chest.

 Zhu Honghong calmed down as if doused with cold water,

 the raging heat and Forceful Energy in his body gradually ceased.

 Everyone watching this scene expressed their amazement.

Hua Wudao's eyes lit up,

 and he explained,

 "This is the technique and experience I was talking about earlier.

 Zhu Honghong,

 after all,

 is a Cultivator of the Divine Court Realm,

 Way of Transformation,

 with extremely chaotic Primal Energy inside his body.

 Forcibly suppressing it would only backfire.

 Using gentle and relatively weaker Forceful Energy is actually more beneficial.

 Do not underestimate that palm strike; without exceptional control,

 it is difficult to achieve without hurting the person.

Zhao Yue nodded,

 "Listening to Elder Hua,

 I've gained quite a bit of insight.

Hua Wudao sighed,

 "It's nothing to speak of.

 Sometimes I really envy you all,

 the master leads the way,

 but cultivation is up to the individual.

 The Pavilion Lord manages countless affairs,

 perhaps not having much time to impart cultivation insights,

 but the Pavilion Lord's teachings by example are more effective than those abstract theories.

 Unfortunately,

 I am too old now to have such an opportunity.

The disciples were left speechless by the words: "Why does this sound off?

 Elder Hua's words seem fine,

 but they're a bit awkward.

 Are you sure he's not boasting or flattering?

Lu Zhou stood with his hands behind his back,

 quietly watching Old Eighth.

 He felt equally speechless in his heart; the palm strike he had delivered earlier wasn't thought through that much—it was simply meant to calm Old Eighth down.

 Whether it hurt him or not didn't matter,

 as Old Eighth was tough enough to handle it.

At this moment,

 Old Eighth regained some energy and crawled and rolled to kneel in front of Lu Zhou,

 crying and calling out,

 "Master,

 you're here!

Lu Zhou looked at him calmly: "Speak,

 what happened?

Zhu Honghong,

 frightened,

 shivered and quickly confessed,

 "Master,

 three days ago,

 the Upper Prime Five Rats stole my Precious Zen Robe.

 The Precious Zen Robe helps suppress my chaotic Forceful Energy.

 Please,

 master,

 stand up for me!

"Upper Prime Five Rats?

" Lu Zhou asked,

 puzzled.

Old Eighth nodded righteously: "They wanted to take me away from Golden Court Mountain,

 but how could I be that kind of person?

 I flatly refused their unreasonable demands.

 The Five Rats,

 in their desperation,

 stole my Precious Zen Robe.

 It's truly despicable!

 I hope for master's discernment!

 My loyalty is as clear as the sun and the moon,

 I hope for master's discernment!

Zhu Honghong deliberately raised his voice towards the end,

 leaving Ming Shiyin somewhat speechless: "Is this still the same naïve and foolish Old Eighth?

 He’s quite eloquent now!

Lu Zhou continued to inquire: "How many levels have you cultivated of the Nine Tribulations Thunderous Energy?

Zhu Honghong,

 sweating profusely,

 stammered in reply: "Master.

 the seventh level,

 Celestial Phenomena.

"With your level of cultivation and experience,

 you actually dared to attempt completing the remaining two levels of the technique?

"I dare not!

" Zhu Honghong's forehead touched the ground,

 trembling violently.

The disciple is foolish; when cultivating the fourth level of the Nine Tribulations Thunderous Energy,

 Cherishing Flowers,

 and the fifth level,

 Forgetting Emotions,

 a mishap occurred,

 causing Primal Energy chaos and almost leading to demonic possession.

So,

 did Old Seventh,

 that wayward disciple,

 think of a way to obtain the Heaven-Chosen Temple's Precious Zen Robe to suppress your Primal Energy?

Zhu Honghong had no choice but to nod in response: "Yes.

At this point,

 Ming Shiyin reminded,

 "Master,

 don't fall for Old Seventh's tricks.

 He is currently under the Body-Binding Divine Spell and is trying to deceive you into acting.

 I suspect that in cases like Old eighth's,

 only a Body-Binding Spell can suppress it,

 or else the problem will recur.

 After casting the Body-Binding Spell,

 only you can release it.

 Therefore,

 I suspect that Old Seventh has left some sort of linking spell or seal on Old eighth,

 sharing the method to undo the spell through this means!

The so-called linking spells are also a type of secret technique within the Taoist tradition.

 Cultivators linked by this technique can share any inflicted damage or healing over a certain period.

 Later,

 the Buddhist sect adapted this technique into the Illuminating Buddha's Light,

 forming a group healing secret technique that can heal multiple people simultaneously.

 However,

 it consumes a lot,

 and few people use it.

After Ming Shiyin finished speaking,

 he looked at Old eighth with pride: "Old Seventh,

 you can't even trap me with your schemes,

 let alone the Master?

At this moment,

 Hua Wudao chimed in: "Ming Shiyin speaks wisely.

Lu Zhou did not express any opinion but instead focused his gaze on Zhu Honghong: "Old eighth,

 your teacher is waiting for your explanation.

Zhu Honghong was in tears: "Master,

 I am wronged!

"Wronged my foot!

 Old Seventh has helped you so many times,

 your motives for helping him are too great.

Lu Zhou then spoke: "Why not check to see if it's true or not?

If there truly is a linking spell,

 then Ming Shiyin's deduction would be correct; otherwise,

 it would not.

Ming Shiyin and others then began to check with tools.

 After a moment,

 the inspection was complete,

 and Duan Musheng bowed to Lu Zhou: "Master,

 the check is complete,

 nothing was found.

Ming Shiyin felt somewhat embarrassed: "This is bad,

 excessive suspicion,

 Master is definitely going to scold us now.

However,

 Lu Zhou did not blame him: "Just because it's not found now doesn't mean it won't be later; what Ming Shiyin said is not without reason.

Zhu Honghong,

 still with tears streaming down his face: "I have never been so wronged in my life,

 I am wronged!

Ming Shiyin,

 feeling awkward,

 stepped forward and wiped his tears: "Old eighth,

 stop making excuses.

 The Five Rats took your Precious Zen Robe but didn't try to take you away.

"Do you still expect Old Seventh to help you?

 He's just using you.

As soon as the Precious Zen Robe was mentioned,

 Zhu Honghong's eyes bulged with energy.

 This item was his lifeline; losing the Precious Zen Robe was almost like taking his life.

"Master,

 I have something to say.

 I know you are punishing Seventh Brother,

 and I have a plan!

" Zhu Honghong said.

Ming Shiyin looked at him with a complex expression: "With his intelligence,

 he wants to offer a plan?

 How does this sound so unreliable?

Zhu Honghong gave an awkward smile: "Master,

 I know where Old Seventh and the Five Rats like to meet.

Ming Shiyin asked doubtfully: "With Old Seventh's abilities,

 would he let you know such a confidential matter?

Zhu Honghong chuckled: "I found out about it by accident.

 Besides,

 at that time,

 Seventh Brother trusted me a lot.

"So you turned around and betrayed him?

" Ming Shiyin asked.

Zhu Honghong didn't know what to say in response.

Lu Zhou then spoke up: "Where?

While Zhu Honghong's clue might not be valuable,

 it was better than nothing,

 and they still had to guard against the wayward disciple's potential deeper schemes.

 He wasn't worried about these,

 as for him,

 seeing Si Wuya was all that mattered; the rest was insignificant.

 Any conspiracy or trickery pales before absolute power,

 as if it were mere paper.

Zhu Honghong answered: "Upper Prime City,

 Long Wind Tavern.

Zhao Yue was somewhat surprised: "The Black Cavalry once went to Upper Prime City to quell unrest,

 and the Five Rats still dare to stay in Upper Prime City?

"The most dangerous place is the safest place.

 These rats are unrecognized by anyone; even if they stood in the middle of the street,

 you might not know them.

 Meeting in Upper Prime City doesn't surprise me at all.

" Ming Shiyin explained.

Lu Zhou then called out Ming Shiyin's name: "Ming Shiyin.

"Disciple here.

"You will go to Upper Prime City to bring back Si Wuya.

 Also,

 inform the Upper Prime Five Rats that it would be wise for them to come to the mountain to confess their sins,

 or else they will bear the consequences.

After hearing this,

 Ming Shiyin did not dare to be careless: "Disciple obeys.

Zhu Honghong moved closer,

 smiling timidly: "Master,

 does this count as making a merit?

 I hope Master and my brothers will help me retrieve the Precious Zen Robe!

Upon hearing this,

 Lu Zhou's gaze fell on him: "Wayward disciple,

 what should be done for withholding information?

 Old Eighth,

 knowing the contact point yet concealing it until now,

 shows selfish motives.

Zhu Honghong,

 terrified,

 knelt down again: "Disciple knows his mistake!

"Fifty strokes with the staff,

 Duan Musheng will execute.

" Lu Zhou said coldly.

"Disciple obeys.

" Zhu Honghong replied.

After speaking,

 Lu Zhou turned his back: "Proceed.

Seeing that the master had not left,

 Zhu Honghong felt very distressed; clearly,

 his elder wanted to supervise personally,

 making these fifty strokes possibly more painful than a hundred in the past.

"Senior brother,

 go easy.

He was just about to plead when he saw Duan Musheng carrying a large tree trunk walking briskly in.

"Sorry,

 junior brother,

 the rules are the rules,

 and it's better to err on the side of severity.

 It’s for your own good.

 If even a place as grand as Golden Court Mountain has no discipline,

 how can we restore its former glory?

" After saying this,

 Duan Musheng struck Zhu Honghong.

A pig-like scream immediately spread throughout the entire back mountain.

For the severe punishment of the wayward disciple Zhu Honghong,

 500 Merit Points are awarded.

After hearing the prompt,

 Lu Zhou did not even glance at Zhu Honghong and turned to leave Reflection Cave.

Ming Shiyin patted Zhu Honghong on the butt and chuckled,

 "Old eighth,

 you got what you deserved.

 Getting fifty lashes is still better than having your cultivation destroyed or your life taken.

 I'll figure out a way to get your Precious Zen Robe back.

Zhu Honghong was overjoyed upon hearing this: "Still.

 my brother treats me well!

Ming Shiyin didn’t look back at him,

 turning to leave.

 Pan Zhong hurried up to him: "Mr.

 Fourth is truly meticulous and wise.

 If it weren’t for Mr.

 Fourth seeing through the deception,

 we might all have been fooled by Mr.

 Seventh,

 the traitor.

Ming Shiyin felt there was something off about him: "Is there something you need?

Pan Zhong answered earnestly,

 I truly admire Mr.

 Fourth from the bottom of my heart,

 without any falsehood.

"I just love hearing you talk,

 all flattery and fawning,

 yet it sounds so sincere.

" Having said that,

 Ming Shiyin leapt and left Reflection Cave.

Meanwhile,

 in a tranquil small building,

 Si Wuya was not trying to decipher the divine spell as before but was looking at the night sky,

 seemingly lost in thought.

He couldn't figure it out; when had his master mastered such profound divine spell techniques?

 On a nearby shelf,

 various books about divine spells were somewhat disordered.

 These books had been collected from searches he had ordered.

 He had been studying daily how to break the divine spell,

 but despite trying almost all the methods mentioned in these books,

 none had worked.

At that moment,

 a subordinate approached from a distance: "Master,

 we have checked; Evil Sky Pavilion has not had any dealings with Buddhist or Taoist masters.

Si Wuya asked,

 "The Buddhist master from the Runan Sanctuary,

 the Taoist master from Crossing the Sky River,

 the Great Hand Seal of the Nine Characters from Tang Zi Town,

 and even the unknown forces on the Lotus Platform—are all these unrelated to the outside world?

The subordinate shook his head: "No clues were found,

 Master.

 Should we continue the investigation?

"No need.

 It can essentially be confirmed.

 The master is seeking new methods.

"Have you found any spies from the Evil Sky Pavilion?

" Si Wuya asked.

The subordinate replied,

 we only know that the opponent is skilled,

 but we do not know who it is.

"What about the palace?

"No spies in the palace have been found either.

 However,

 we did receive another piece of information; a master from the Western Frontier Loulan has entered the palace.

 This person is likely the instigator behind the Lotus Platform formation.

"This Moli really has some methods,

 you may go.

The subordinate replied "Yes" and then left the place.

 Before long,

 another subordinate hurried over.

"Master,

 a report from Upper Prime City—the Upper Prime Five Rats have stolen Mr.

 Eight's Precious Zen Robe!

 They claim to use the item to offset the compensation for the mission against Evil Sky Pavilion.

Hearing this,

 Si Wuya's eyes snapped open: "Foolish!

"Master,

 the Upper Prime Five Rats are not from the Dark Net,

 and are hard to control.

 Should we take this opportunity to eliminate them all?

Si Wuya didn't speak,

 pondering for a moment before saying,

 "Send a flying letter to the Five Rats,

 meet in Upper Prime City in two days.

"Master,

 your current situation is not suitable for appearing in public,

 I can handle all matters on your behalf!

Si Wuya shook his head and replied,

 "No matter.

 The master from Western Frontier Loulan has arrived,

 Upper Prime has been too quiet for too long,

 it's time to start a fire.

"Yes!

 I will take care of it!

The time soon came to the next day,

 and Lu Zhou slowly opened his eyes from the state of contemplating the Heavenly Writing.

 He felt the extraordinary power,

 still a long way from saturation.

 However,

 fortunately,

 the speed of contemplation was faster than before; previously it took seven to ten days to reach saturation,

 but now it would only take about five days.

He came to the table and looked down at the ancient parchment map.

 Compared to the day before,

 there were no changes to the ancient parchment,

 only the pattern of the Divine Capital palace was slightly clearer,

 the rest remained blurred or blank.

"Other fragments of the Heavenly Writing might just be in the palace,

 but how to find them?

 though greatly skilled,

 is looking for a needle in a haystack,

 and moreover,

 Jiang Aijian doesn't even know what the Heavenly Writing looks like.

 Should I make a trip myself?

While pondering,

 the voice of Duan Musheng came from outside: "Master,

 Old eighth's Primal Energy is chaotic just like yesterday.

Lu Zhou said,

 "Send Pan Zhong over to seal his meridians,

 Energy Center,

 and Energy Sea.

 If that doesn't hold,

 just keep hitting him until his Primal Energy is depleted.

Duan Musheng's eyes lit up at this: "Master's insight is profound,

 why didn't I think of that?

 It's been a long time since anyone practiced together.

He was just about to turn and leave.

At this moment,

 Lu Zhou asked,

 "Where is Zhao Yue?

Zhao Yue's behavior had been somewhat strange recently,

 necessitating extra attention.

 Plus,

 it was usually Zhao Yue who delivered messages,

 so it didn’t make sense for Duan Musheng to come suddenly.

Duan Musheng answered,

 "Sister Zhao Yue is unwell,

 resting in the South Pavilion.

"Unwell?

" Lu Zhou was puzzled after hearing this.

 By the stage of Divine Court Realm's Way of Transformation,

 common illnesses should be far behind.

 "Go and attend to Old eighth.

"I will go now.

" Duan Musheng responded and turned to leave.

Lu Zhou then made his way to the South Pavilion.

 The pavilion was quiet,

 seemingly nothing unusual.

 Lu Zhou stood outside the South Pavilion and observed quietly for a while,

 then transmitted his voice,

 "Zhao Yue.

A surprised voice came from the room: "Master?

Lu Zhou walked over with his hands behind his back,

 but he did not immediately enter.

 From Zhao Yue's voice,

 he detected a hint of tension and pain.

 As he approached the doorway,

 a wave of icy cold energy rushed at him.

 Lu Zhou frowned,

 waved his hand,

 and a burst of forceful energy directly flung the door open.

 His gaze fell on Zhao Yue.

Zhao Yue was not resting but rather curled up in a corner,

 trembling,

 her head covered in cold sweat.

 Her body and hair were stained with the cold energy.

 Alternating between cold and hot,

 half of her hair was wet,

 and a thin layer of white frost even covered the surface of her clothes.

Zhao Yue didn't expect her master to visit suddenly.

 She quickly endured the cold,

 knelt down,

 and said,

 "Disciple greets Master.

Seeing her in this state,

 Lu Zhou shook his head helplessly,

 having a good understanding of what was going on.

 His disciples,

 each one more worrisome than the last!

The Clear Jade Technique is a profound and powerful cultivation method,

 which Zhao Yue had chosen to practice on her own initiative.

 When this technique is fully activated,

 the practitioner's appearance becomes increasingly transparent,

 as if shrouded in cold mist.

 Primal energy lingers outside the skin and,

 when condensed into forceful energy,

 causes alternating cold and heat.

 Zhao Yue's cultivation method was not wrong,

 but in her eagerness for progress,

 she lacked sufficient protective energy to resist the invasion of the cold energy.

 Rushing the process only brought her suffering.

Lu Zhou sighed deeply and looked at Zhao Yue,

 asking,

 "Why?

Zhao Yue lowered her head,

 not daring to look at him.

 "Disciple knows her mistake.

 I shouldn't have been so impatient.

"Is that all?

"Disciple dares not say.

"Speak.

Zhao Yue did not dare to hide anything,

 and explained everything in detail: "I don't know what happened.

 Since practicing the completed technique,

 the flow of my Primal Energy has become extremely erratic,

 and my cultivation speed has actually decreased significantly.

Lu Zhou found this very strange,

 as this issue had not occurred with any of the other disciples.

The other disciples had increased their cultivation speed significantly after receiving the completed techniques.

 The fastest was Little Yuan'er,

 who entered the Nascent Divinity Tribulation Realm in a very short time.

 Zhao Yue started her training earlier than Little Yuan'er,

 and even if her talent was not as great as Little Yuan'er's,

 she should not be falling behind this much.

"Don't move.

" He then gently raised his hand,

 a faint Primal Energy drifted from his palm and landed on Zhao Yue.

 Sure enough,

 when the Primal Energy entered Zhao Yue's meridians,

 a cold energy pushed back,

 trying to expel Lu Zhou's Primal Energy.

"Not right.

 This cold energy does not originate from the Clear Jade Technique; it is very unusual and eerie,

 seemingly existing in her body for a long time.

Lu Zhou withdrew his hand and calmly said,

 "Lift your head.

 I ask you,

 what techniques did you practice before you joined Evil Sky Pavilion?

Zhao Yue shook her head: "None.

"Do not lie!

Zhao Yue hurriedly responded,

 "Every word I say is true!

"I bestowed upon you the Clear Jade Technique; how many levels have you mastered?

Zhao Yue replied: "I am slow,

 having mastered only six levels; the seventh level is still not well-practiced.

 The two final levels of the technique you completed are obscure and difficult to understand,

 and I have not yet had the chance to practice them.

"So,

 the last two levels of the technique are not the main cause; at most,

 they triggered the issue.

 The cold poison in Zhao Yue's body is the real problem.

 Think again,

 before you practiced the Clear Jade Technique,

 did you encounter any Cultivators,

 practice unknown techniques,

 or sustain injuries?

 This cold poison must have a source; it couldn't have appeared out of nowhere.

After hearing this,

 Zhao Yue fell into deep thought: "I was only nine when I entered the sect,

 and I don't remember much.

Lu Zhou pressed further: "What about before you were nine?

Sorting out the events after she joined the Evil Sky Pavilion was manageable,

 but recalling her life before that required her own memories.

 Zhao Yue hesitated,

 her face showing signs of panic.

"Are you still hiding something?

At her master's stern call,

 Zhao Yue nervously lowered her head: "I dare not!

 Some say I came from the palace,

 but I didn't believe them.

"Who told you this?

"I don't know him,

 but I could tell he was a master,

 likely from the palace too.

 I had just met Sister Tianxin and she asked me to activate a formation.

 I encountered this person when I was at Green Sun Mountain,

 and you know what happened after that,

 Master.

Ye Tianxin,

 leading Cultivators,

 ambushed Lu Zhou at Green Sun Mountain; how could Lu Zhou possibly forget.

 Ye Tianxin is probably the boldest among these nine disciples.

 Recalling that Ye Tianxin was expelled from Evil Sky Pavilion long ago.

 I wonder if she is alive or dead now?

"Since you come from the palace,

 you should go there to investigate.

Zhao Yue bent forward in response: "Disciple remembers the rules of Evil Sky Pavilion,

 once entering the Pavilion,

 all ties to the past are severed,

 I dare not overstep.

"If I am not mistaken,

 the cold poison you are afflicted with is the Mystic Dark Palm Seal.

 This is an extremely sinister Taoist seal,

 do you really not plan to investigate?

Zhao Yue shook her head after hearing this.

Lu Zhou's gaze fell again on the jade pendant atop Zhao Yue's head,

 recalling the scene when he took her as a disciple.

 She has worn this jade pendant since childhood,

 and now,

 thinking back,

 it indeed seems very suspicious.

 How could an ordinary family possess such a valuable jade pendant?

"Someone bring Flowers and Moon Journey here.

The female disciple outside the door received the order and left immediately.

 Shortly after,

 Flowers and Moon Journey appeared in the South Pavilion.

"Flowers and Moon Journey greets the Pavilion Lord!

Lu Zhou nodded and asked,

 "How long did you serve in the palace?

"Replying to Pavilion Lord,

 less than a year.

"During this year,

 did you encounter any master skilled in using the Mystic Dark Palm Seal?

"Mystic Dark Palm Seal?

" Flowers and Moon Journey shook her head in confusion.

 "I have not seen it.

 However,

 there are many masters in the palace from various sects,

 perhaps there is a Cultivator skilled in the Mystic Dark Palm Seal.

"That's equivalent to no answer.

 Enough,

 you may leave.

"Flowers and Moon Journey takes her leave.

" She then exited the room,

 muttering to herself as she walked,

 "The Pavilion Lord seems very gentle.

After Flowers and Moon Journey left,

 Lu Zhou approached Zhao Yue and took off his upper garment,

 revealing his muscular torso.

 He said to Zhao Yue,

 "Sit properly.

Zhao Yue was delighted upon hearing this,

 her face flushed with a hint of excitement in her eyes: "Disciple thanks Master!

The old demon,

 Lu Zhou,

 removed his clothing and gently placed his hand on the female disciple’s body.

 "Do not resist.

Hearing her master's words,

 Zhao Yue quickly replied,

 "Yes.

Lu Zhou decided to try using the extraordinary power,

 knowing that even if it didn't work,

 there wouldn't be any loss.

 the extraordinary power of the Heavenly Writing obeyed his command once more,

 cooperating even more than before and seamlessly integrating into the Primal Energy.

 The Primal Energy smoothly entered Zhao Yue's body through her acupoints and flowed into her major meridians without any sign.

Zhao Yue suddenly spat out a mouthful of fresh blood!

 The cold poison indeed resisted immediately.

 Seeing this,

 Lu Zhou snorted coldly: "Just some cold poison!

 Daring to resist!

" He then mobilized the Primal Energy again,

 unleashing a stronger force of the Heavenly Writing.

 The originally transparent and colorless Primal Energy turned as if dyed in deep blue,

 becoming incredibly splendid.

 Near his palm,

 it seemed as if indescribable blue fireflies were swirling around,

 quickly forcing out the cold poison lingering in the meridians.

In an instant,

 the force of the Heavenly Writing crushed and diminished it,

 and the cold poison in Zhao Yue's meridians weakened at a terrifying rate until it disappeared.

Meanwhile,

 Flowers and Moon Journey,

 who had left the Eastern Pavilion not long ago,

 found herself increasingly puzzled.

 Perhaps because she had spent some time in the palace,

 doing whatever the Jade Consort asked without questioning the reasons.

 Now that she was in the Evil Sky Pavilion,

 this habit persisted.

 She scratched her head,

 unable to understand why the Pavilion Lord had asked her that question.

At that moment,

 Pan Zhong and Pan Litian appeared in her view.

 Pan Zhong called out from a distance: "Miss Flowers,

 hello.

Flowers and Moon Journey raised an eyebrow at this: "What did you call me?

Pan Zhong hurriedly corrected himself in embarrassment: "I didn't mean that,

 Elder Sister Flowers.

Flowers and Moon Journey was utterly speechless.

 Pan Litian slapped Pan Zhong on the neck,

 his eyes showing some frustration: "Miss Moon Journey,

 you should call her Miss Moon Journey.

"Miss Moon Journey.

" Pan Zhong finally caught on.

Pan Litian stepped forward to inquire: "Miss Moon Journey,

 may I see the Pavilion Lord?

Flowers and Moon Journey curiously asked: "Do you have business with the Pavilion Lord,

 senior?

Pan Litian said: "I was fortunate to receive the Black Magnolia from the Pavilion Lord,

 and now that my Energy Center and Energy Sea have just begun to open,

 I naturally owe him thanks.

"Senior,

 has your cultivation been restored?

" Having heard stories and legends about Pan Litian,

 the number one expert of the Clarity Sect,

 such figures only existed in the stories told by elders during her childhood.

 Naturally,

 she was surprised to hear about his recovery.

Pan Litian shook his head: "It's not about recovery yet; that will take time.

 Within five years,

 I will return to the peak.

Pan Zhong nodded with a smile at the side.

 These days,

 Pan Litian often sought out Pan Zhong for chats,

 and the two had become more familiar with each other than others.

 Yet,

 Pan Litian was unwilling to acknowledge Pan Zhong’s identity,

 thinking that since both were from the Clarity Sect,

 the senior was merely looking out for him.

 Thus,

 he didn't think much about it; setting aside age,

 they seemed like old friends who hadn't seen each other for a long time.

 Sometimes,

 they were informal,

 and Pan Litian didn't mind.

Flowers and Moon Journey clasped her hands in congratulations: "Congratulations,

 senior.

Pan Litian also clasped his fists in response: "You haven't told this old man where the Pavilion Lord is.

 I’ve been to the Eastern Pavilion and the main hall of the Evil Sky Pavilion but haven’t seen the Pavilion Lord.

Flowers and Moon Journey answered: "He's in the South Pavilion,

 and should be coming out soon.

"Thank you,

 thank you,

 Miss Flowers.

" Pan Zhong hastily covered his mouth; the words had slipped out without thinking.

 Just then,

 a faint blue energy radiated from Zhao Yue’s residence,

 spreading outwards like a tide.

"Be careful!

 Activate your protective Forceful Energy!

The three were immediately startled and simultaneously activated their protective Forceful Energy,

 forming a transparent barrier in front of them.

 However,

 the barrier only held for a few seconds before shattering like glass.

 The three stepped back several paces before the energy gradually subsided.

They looked in the direction of Zhao Yue's residence with shocked expressions.

"What kind of power is this?

" Flowers and Moon Journey asked,

 puzzled.

Hearing Flowers and Moon Journey's confusion,

 Pan Litian explained: "It's the power of the barrier.

"Why would the Pavilion Lord use the power of the barrier?

" Flowers and Moon Journey couldn't understand.

Not just her,

 even the immensely experienced Pan Litian couldn't figure it out.

While the three were perplexed,

 Lu Zhou walked out of the South Pavilion with his hands behind his back.

 His gaze swept over the three,

 finally settling on Pan Litian.

"How does it feel to regain your cultivation?

Pan Litian bowed deeply: "I am deeply grateful to the Pavilion Lord for his grace.

 From now on,

 my life belongs to Evil Sky Pavilion.

Lu Zhou noted Pan Litian's steadily increasing loyalty,

 which was evident in his speech.

 Pan Litian spoke neither humbly nor arrogantly,

 neither hurriedly nor slowly,

 composed and forceful.

 Pan Litian was the first to express his loyalty in such words,

 and regardless of his sincerity,

 these words were pleasing to hear.

Flowers and Moon Journey and Pan Zhong both muttered to themselves: "Experience really does come with age.

 Compared to him,

 we are completely green.

Pan Litian continued: "When I entered the Eastern Pavilion earlier,

 I felt a surge of powerful energy.

 The Pavilion Lord's cultivation level is truly an eye-opener for me!

 Such unique energy,

 I have seen it for the first time.

 Probably only the Pavilion Lord could achieve this in the whole world.

Flowers and Moon Journey and Pan Zhong were both taken aback; are these really not just flatteries?

Lu Zhou,

 however,

 didn't feel anything amiss as Pan Litian was telling the truth.

 He suddenly remembered that Pan Litian,

 having traveled far and wide,

 was as experienced as he was,

 and thus asked: "Zhao Yue was afflicted by the Mystic Dark Palm Seal's cold poison in her childhood,

 Elder Pan,

 have you heard of this?

"Mystic Dark Palm Seal?

" Pan Litian furrowed his brow,

 pondered for a moment,

 "Mystic Dark Palm Seal is a particularly sinister method within the Taoist traditions.

 I do indeed know of a person skilled in using the Mystic Dark Palm Seal.

Lu Zhou said nothing.

 Pan Litian's travels were not just simple wanderings; it is said that after leaving Clarity Sect,

 he was closely associated with certain figures in the palace for a considerable time,

 although no one knows exactly what he did during that period.

Pan Litian stroked his beard and continued: "This person is Li Yunzhao,

 a master close to the Dowager Empress.

As soon as he finished speaking,

 a harsh coughing sound came from Zhao Yue inside the room.

Hearing this name,

 Zhao Yue also remembered something.

"Master,

 I remember now,

 the person who came to see me that day was Li Yunzhao!

This person came from the Taoist sect but later practiced some evil techniques that led him into demonic cultivation,

 yet it paradoxically advanced his skills.

 Considering face,

 the Taoist sect expelled him.

 Many years later,

 he suddenly became a master within the imperial palace.

Lu Zhou was somewhat surprised to hear this.

 He was not surprised by the presence of many masters in the palace; he himself had been to the palace a few times but had never competed with any palace masters.

 Perhaps they were wary of his reputation as the foremost demon in the world,

 or perhaps bound by the rules within the palace walls.

 However,

 the fact that Li Yunzhao turned out to be a prominent eunuch was unexpected.

"Such a master lives a life of luxury; even as a eunuch,

 he receives much flattery and favor from the powerful.

 Sadly,

 not being a real man is a significant regret in life.

"Li Yunzhao injured you,

 then he looked at Zhao Yue and asked,

 but why come looking for you now?

 What is his purpose?

Zhao Yue weakly replied that she did not know.

Lu Zhou shook his head: "Never mind,

 rest and recuperate for a couple of days.

After saying this,

 he walked towards the Eastern Pavilion.

 Zhao Yue watched her master's retreating figure in a daze,

 surprised by his recent words.

 Could it be that her master was actually showing concern for others?

 She then went back inside and carefully sensed the condition of the cold poison in her body,

 finding it gone,

 which was a surprise.

 Until now,

 she had not realized it was cold poison; she thought it was an effect of practicing the Clear Jade Technique.

 The cold and heat perfectly matched the characteristics of the Clear Jade Technique,

 where ultimate practice results in a layer of frost on the skin,

 preserving youthfulness.

 Unexpectedly,

 it was the cold poison from the Mystic Dark Palm Seal.

 She once again channeled her Primal Energy through her meridians very smoothly,

 with no feeling of congestion,

 and the self-healing effect of the Primal Energy was also much stronger than before.

 Recalling the words her master said as he left made her feel even more ashamed.

 Compared to these,

 the hardships she had previously endured seemed trivial.

Training Zhao Yue,

 reward 200 merit points.

What is training?

 When an elder guides a junior,

 or the more powerful party instructs the weaker,

 this is called training.

After returning to the main hall of the Evil Sky Pavilion,

 Lu Zhou asked Pan Litian if he knew Li Yunzhao.

 Pan Litian clasped his hands in response: "After leaving the Clarity Sect,

 I indeed had dealings with the palace.

 Frankly,

 during those years,

 I joined the military and went to the battlefield,

 killing countless enemies in the Western Frontier region,

 and thus I rarely interacted with those within the palace walls.

 I do not know much about Li Yunzhao.

Pan Zhong was somewhat astonished to hear this; could this unremarkable-looking elder really have such a legendary past worth boasting about?

 It's not uncommon for Cultivators to join the military,

 but more often,

 Cultivators focus on pursuing the Dao.

 A force of ten thousand might only have five or six Cultivators,

 including one great Cultivator,

 and some at the rank of centurion or decurion.

Those without the talent for cultivation,

 or who only reached the Quenched Body Realm or Mystic Enlightening Realm,

 chose to earn their merits in the military.

 It was unexpected that Pan Litian would do so too.

"With your cultivation,

 you could easily turn the tide of battle.

 Isn’t earning military honors like taking candy from a baby?

" Lu Zhou implied that with military honors under his belt,

 why still appear so aged and weary.

Pan Litian sighed deeply: "After leaving the Clarity Sect,

 my cultivation was greatly reduced; I was no longer a master.

"In that case,

 it seems I need to make a trip to the Divine Capital myself.

After hearing this,

 Pan Litian said: "I am willing to go with you.

Lu Zhou nodded: "You may leave.

"I take my leave,

 junior bids farewell.

Moments later,

 Little Yuan'er came bounding in from outside.

 Lu Zhou asked: "Is there any news from the fourth?

Little Yuan'er replied: "No,

 the fourth senior brother left for Upper Prime City early this morning; he should have arrived by now.

Lu Zhou stroked his beard and nodded: "Your master is tired.

Sensing the cue,

 Little Yuan'er tactfully left the hall.

 Using the extraordinary power to expel the cold poison from Zhao Yue had taken some of his energy.

 Lu Zhou needed to replenish his extraordinary power within the next two days.

 Without the aid of any artifact cards,

 this Heavenly Writing ability was his greatest reliance at the moment.

 As for Zhao Yue's origins,

 that would have to be clarified later.

Two days later,

 in the Long Wind Tavern of Upper Prime City,

 Si Wuya stood by the window,

 overlooking the entirety of Upper Prime City.

 This once auxiliary capital of the Great Flame had lost its former prosperity.

 The Five Rats had turned Upper Prime upside down,

 and together with the rebels,

 had nearly destroyed the city.

A gray-robed Cultivator approached him from behind: "Master,

 our people are in place,

 ready to act on your command.

Si Wuya glanced at him,

 then looked back out the window: "Zhixing,

 how long have you been with me?

Ye Zhixing was momentarily stunned,

 then answered: "Ten years.

"It has been ten years in the blink of an eye.

 Zhixing,

 do you think I can make mistakes?

Ye Zhixing quickly bowed: "Why would Master say such a thing?

 The Dark Net has come this far all thanks to Master.

 You stopped tens of thousands of Cultivators at the Northern Frontier,

 you supported the Great Teacher to establish the present Underworld Sect,

Si Wuya raised his hand to interrupt Ye Zhixing's words: "Every time we discuss these accomplishments,

 Zhixing,

 you recount them like treasured memories.

 It might be my misconception,

 but lately,

 too many things have slipped out of control.

Ye Zhixing looked at Si Wuya with a complex expression: "You cannot lose confidence.

After saying this,

 he drew his sword to make a point: "Whoever the Master commands me to kill,

 I will kill,

 even if it means going up against Evil Sky Pavilion!

"How dare you!

" Si Wuya's eyebrows furrowed tightly.

"I dare not disrespect Evil Sky Pavilion.

 I spoke without thinking,

 I beg for Master's forgiveness.

Si Wuya shook his head,

 then looked out the window again.

"Get up.

 When can we expect the Upper Prime Five Rats?

Ye Zhixing answered: "The appointment was set for this morning,

 but I have something to say,

 though I'm not sure if I should.

"Without Master's permission,

 the Five Rats took Mr.

 Eight's Precious Zen Robe,

 which must have alarmed the old senior.

 Eight is always.

" Ye Zhixing paused,

 searching for a diplomatic way to describe timidity but couldn't find one.

"I understand what you mean.

 Are you worried that Old Eighth might betray our contact points?

"Master is wise.

 Since Master and Mr.

 Eight are close,

 some of our usual contact points had to be discontinued.

 I'm concerned that the old senior,

 furious,

 might send people here.

Si Wuya smiled: "Only the fourth senior brother is tough to deal with,

 but he can't get the better of me.

"What if the old senior himself comes?

"Then I'll flee.

" Si Wuya said these words with a casual air,

 as if it was no trouble at all.

Ye Zhixing thought about it too; fleeing from a top-tier expert like the old senior isn't shameful at all.

As they spoke,

 a figure flashed across the roof opposite,

 disappearing in an instant.

"Is that them?

" Si Wuya's gaze returned from the window.

"Please,

 have a seat.

Hearing this,

 the figure appeared inside the tavern like a gust of wind in the blink of an eye.

"Master has good eyesight.

He looked at one of the Five Rats,

 Lu Qiuping,

 and asked: "Did you come alone?

Hearing Si Wuya's inquiry,

 Lu Qiuping chuckled: "I alone am enough.

 The boss said you are too cunning,

 you might have set a trap here to catch all five of us in one go!

Si Wuya was silent for a moment: "Speak,

 how do you want to resolve this?

Lu Qiuping crossed his arms confidently: "According to the Five Rats' rules,

 payment is due regardless of success or failure.

Ye Zhixing snorted upon hearing this: "According to the rules of the Dark Net,

 those who fail a mission must accept punishment.

 And you still dare to dream of compensation?

Lu Qiuping appeared indifferent: "I'm not one of your Dark Net people,

 don't impose your rules on me.

" Ye Zhixing said as he drew his long sword.

Seeing this,

 Lu Qiuping chuckled: "Hey,

 why should we resort to swords?

Si Wuya sipped his tea calmly and spoke: "Hand over the Precious Zen Robe.

Lu Qiuping hesitated before responding: "The Precious Zen Robe is with the boss,

 not on me.

 Don't look at me like that,

 I'm just here to give you a heads up.

 You are a disciple of Evil Sky Pavilion,

 we can't afford to provoke you but can't we avoid you?

"From now on,

 let's cut all ties,

 go our separate ways,

 and owe nothing to each other,

" Lu Qiuping said.

Si Wuya shook his head upon hearing this: "I sought you out because I valued your capabilities and hoped you could serve me.

 I was prepared to overlook the failure of the Evil Sky Pavilion's mission,

 but you should never have taken the Precious Zen Robe.

After saying this,

 he flicked the wine cup from his hand.

 The wine cup traced a perfect parabola in the air and fell onto the street.

 Members of the Dark Net hidden nearby understood the signal and revealed themselves.

 The entire private room was now enveloped by a special energy.

 Ye Zhixing's eyes turned cold,

 and his long sword trembled.

Lu Qiuping's face changed drastically,

 and with a stamp of his feet,

 he leapt out of the window like lightning.

 At the same time,

 two figures in gray robes attacked from the opposite side.

 Skilled in escape,

 Lu Qiuping slipped through the rooftops like an eel.

 Ye Zhixing looked on in surprise; truly worthy of being one of the Five Rats.

Si Wuya remained calm,

 sitting as if nothing had happened: "You may proceed.

Ye Zhixing responded: "As you command.

" He then took out a cylindrical object from his waist,

 ignited it,

 and launched it out the window.

 A shrill whistling sound and a ring of light immediately burst forth,

 and fireworks exploded in the sky,

 forming the shape of two kitchen knives.

 Seeing this pattern,

 Ye Zhixing immediately felt embarrassed: "Sorry,

 I grabbed the wrong one.

" He quickly took out another cylindrical object and lit it; this time,

 the fireworks formed the shape of a smiling face mask.

 Pedestrians and citizens on the streets all stopped to watch.

 Several squads of Cultivators moved around the corners; they did not target ordinary people but organized and systematically headed towards various locations.

 Upper Prime City was in chaos!

One of the Five Rats,

 hid in a corner watching above: "Si Wuya,

 just you wait!

" Just as he finished speaking,

 Lu Qiuping bumped into someone.

 A man dressed in foreign attire,

 with a thick moustache,

 grabbed his arm.

"You bumped into me?

 Don't block the way,

 get lost.

With a crack,

 the foreign-dressed man exerted strength,

 and Lu Qiuping felt his arm being crushed as if it were broken.

The foreign-dressed man quickly apologized: "Sorry,

 I didn't mean to.

Lu Qiuping felt like crying; he wasn't a fool and naturally knew that no ordinary person could crush a Cultivator who had undergone the Quenched Body Realm so effortlessly.

 There was no time to argue,

 as he was about to be overtaken by pursuers.

 He turned to run,

 but the foreign-dressed man stubbornly held on to him,

 not letting go.

Lu Qiuping had a gloomy face: "Big brother,

 let go,

 let go quickly!

Seeing that the other party wouldn't release his hand,

 he simply pulled out a dagger and stabbed directly at the man.

 The foreign-dressed man's eyes widened,

 and he gripped even harder.

 With a "crack,

" Lu Qiuping's entire arm was crushed!

 Lu Qiuping screamed in agony,

 wanting to move but unable to.

 No matter how hard he tugged,

 he couldn't free his arm,

 and he couldn't walk either.

"Thank you,

 brave man,

 for intervening!

A gray-robed Cultivator rushed over upon hearing this,

 while the foreign-dressed man waved his hand: "It's nothing.

"May I ask the brave man's name?

 You've helped capture this thief,

 I'll come to thank you another day.

"No need,

" the man began,

 "My surname is Ri.

As he said the word "Ri,

" Ye Zhixing,

 supporting Si Wuya,

 stepped into the air and slowly descended.

Lu Qiuping,

 tears streaming down his face,

 endured the pain in his arm and spoke: "Brave man,

 let's talk this through.

The foreign-dressed man responded with a slap: "I have nothing to talk about with you.

After Si Wuya landed,

 he revealed a faint smile: "Fourth senior brother,

 why this disguise?

"Fourth senior brother?

" The gray-robed Cultivators on both sides showed surprised expressions.

 Could it be Ming Shiyin,

 the fourth disciple of Evil Sky Pavilion?

Realizing he was recognized,

 Ming Shiyin dropped the act: "Old Seventh,

 you could even recognize this?

Looking at Ming Shiyin,

 who had disguised himself as a foreign-dressed man,

 Si Wuya smiled slightly,

 teasing: "Not many dare to take the surname 'Ri' (Sun).

Ming Shiyin no longer dwelled on that,

 grasping Lu Qiuping's hand and speaking proudly: "Old Seventh,

 I caught this rat for you,

 aren’t you going to thank me?

Si Wuya nodded: "Thank you,

 fourth senior brother.

Lu Qiuping,

 terrified,

 collapsed on the ground: "Big brother,

 please have mercy where you can.

Ming Shiyin glared at him: "Steal from my Evil Sky Pavilion and still talk of mercy?

 Wishful thinking!

Lu Qiuping looked pleadingly towards Si Wuya: "Our Five Rats have no quarrels or grievances with your Dark Net,

 we'll even forego our fee.

 Rules are made by people,

 can’t we work something out?

Ming Shiyin,

 with a deep and threatening voice,

 said: "I’m not a member of the Dark Net,

 what broken rules are you talking about to me?

Ming Shiyin furrowed his brow and demanded: "Where's the Precious Zen Robe?

Lu Qiuping,

 enduring the pain,

 answered: "It's not on me.

 I just came to meet with Master Si,

 and from now on,

 I will no longer interfere with Evil Sky Pavilion matters.

 Please,

 spare me.

Ming Shiyin,

 after speaking,

 kicked and broke his leg: "Who the hell is your buddy!

 Spare you?

 You're less than nothing!

Then he threw him to Ye Zhixing,

 "Keep an eye on this rat.

 I have some issues to settle with your master.

Ye Zhixing stood with his sword in front,

 "Mr.

 Fourth,

 please forgive me but I cannot agree to your request.

Seeing this,

 Ming Shiyin,

 expressionless,

 uttered one word: "Scram!

" He had lost his patience after several confrontations.

Si Wuya spoke softly: "Zhixing,

 stand down.

Ye Zhixing complied with a nod,

 quickly stepping aside.

 Si Wuya,

 hands behind his back,

 approached Ming Shiyin: "Fourth senior brother,

 please join me upstairs.

"Why meet?

 The second senior brother is not here today; no one's here to protect you.

"Perhaps after hearing what I have to say,

 fourth senior brother might change his mind.

"I won't listen then.

 I know you are good at beguiling people.

 You say you've lost all your cultivation,

 yet these subordinates are still so loyal to you.

 What kind of potion have you fed them?

 the guy who drew his sword just now,

 any interest in joining Evil Sky Pavilion?

 Oh no,

 you're not qualified.

 Never mind.

Ye Zhixing,

 hearing Ming Shiyin's words,

 had a big question mark appear on his forehead.

 Si Wuya then said,

 "Even my senior brother knows I've lost my cultivation; how could I possibly not have some means of self-protection?

As the two spoke,

 the tumult around them grew more intense,

 with sounds of fighting getting closer and more fierce.

 Some flying Cultivators had already taken the battle to the air.

Ming Shiyin was puzzled.

"Why has Upper Prime suddenly become chaotic?

" Ye Zhixing spoke,

 "Mr.

 Fourth,

 to be honest,

 we currently have three thousand brothers in Upper Prime City.

Ming Shiyin was unimpressed: "Threatening me?

 Just a bunch of shrimps and crabs,

 I don't care about them at all.

 Old Seventh,

 I'll listen and see what interesting things you can say.

" After saying that,

 he followed Si Wuya into the Long Wind Tavern.

 The two sat down face to face,

 and Si Wuya spoke first: "I knew you would come,

 yet I still showed up in Upper Prime City.

 Do you know why,

 senior brother?

"How would I know?

 I'm not a worm in your stomach.

"Upper Prime is in chaos,

 and General Shang who guards this place will surely disrupt his own formations.

"What are you really talking about?

"Fourth senior brother,

 if I tell you,

 will you let me go?

"Do you think you're in a position to negotiate?

Si Wuya responded with a resigned smile: "You might not believe it,

 but I came to Upper Prime City to help our master.

 The barrier power of Evil Sky Pavilion is weakening,

 and the righteous sects are watching closely.

 My people are spread across every corner of the world,

 and I have received reliable information that the palace is organizing an unprecedented encirclement against Evil Sky Pavilion.

Si Wuya spoke these words with a very calm tone,

 and wore an expression that said 'believe it or not'.

 Ming Shiyin nonchalantly shook his head: "How many sieges has Evil Sky Pavilion faced before?

 Bring them on; we'll kill as many as come.

" Si Wuya took a drink of water leisurely and swallowed.

 "I admit our master is still sharp,

 can you fend them off forever?

 we both know the truth,

 why deceive ourselves?

"Setting aside the combined attack from the top ten righteous sects,

 Chen Zhu from Crossing the Sky River,

 the Ten Sorcerers of Tang Zi Town,

 and the grand formation at the Lotus Platform,

 all point to the palace.

 One Moli has already been enough of a headache for Evil Sky Pavilion.

 Recently,

 Evil Sky Pavilion has been too conspicuous,

 and the normally conflicting forces within the palace are beginning to unify their views.

 not to mention five years,

 can you guarantee that in two years,

 Evil Sky Pavilion will still be as glorious as it is now?

Ming Shiyin furrowed his brow at this: "Let's worry about the future later.

Si Wuya smiled: "I wouldn't bother explaining this to anyone else,

 but you are my senior brother,

 and I must be honest with you.

 Besides,

 you're intelligent,

 could I really deceive you?

"Don't flatter me.

 Nowadays,

 the top ten righteous sects are no longer what they once were; Clarity Sect has been destroyed,

 and the Orthodox Sect is barely maintained by Zhang Yuanshan.

 The five Buddhist sects always prefer to stay out of trouble.

 With master’s capabilities,

 they wouldn't dare stir for several years.

"The palace is not like the top ten righteous sects.

 Do you know what has allowed the Great Flame dynasty to stand strong till now?

 The answer is obvious.

 If the palace's strength was inferior to the top ten sects,

 then the masters of those sects.

"Would have been meddling in court affairs already if they were unhappy,

 causing chaos long ago.

" Ming Shiyin was somewhat incredulous: "Is the palace really that powerful?

Si Wuya spoke eloquently: "Do you know what things in this world most captivate people's hearts?

 Power,

 wealth,

 women,

 cultivation,

 techniques,

 reputation,

 treasures that are once in a lifetime,

 even the entire world.

After listening,

 Ming Shiyin shook his head and uttered one word: "Worldly.

Si Wuya changed the subject: "Who among us is a sage?

 How many can claim to be above worldly desires?

 Fourth senior brother,

 if you are above worldly desires,

 would you give me the Separation Hook?

 just kidding.

 The palace just happens to be able to fulfill all these desires,

 and thus it can attract capable people from all over.

 Don't forget,

 the Divine Capital's imperial guards have never left,

 not even when the Anyang rebels caused chaos.

 Evil Sky Pavilion has many heavenly weapons and techniques,

 the combined heritage of the top ten sects might not compare to Evil Sky Pavilion.

 In this vast world,

 there are always those envious of Evil Sky Pavilion!

At that moment,

 smoke of battle filled the air outside,

 and the sounds of combat came from all over Upper Prime City,

 with many Cultivators being shot down in the sky.

 Ming Shiyin looked downward and said: "So much talk,

 just to say that Evil Sky Pavilion will fall sooner or later?

 You say you want to help Evil Sky Pavilion,

 is this your way of helping?

Si Wuya stood up,

 also looking out the window: "This is a necessary sacrifice.

 General Shang guards this place; once he dies,

 Upper Prime will surely fall into chaos.

 Wei Zhuoyan has already led his troops toward Liang State.

"The palace won't mobilize the imperial guards,

 so they'll have to send other forces to quell the chaos!

 Naturally,

 the palace will then have no time to deal with Evil Sky Pavilion.

 If once doesn't work,

 then twice.

 If twice doesn't work,

 then ten times.

Upon hearing this,

 Ming Shiyin spit out all the tea he had just drunk: "That's your plan?

 I'd have to be brain-dead to believe you.

 The Dark Net you've painstakingly built,

 with intelligence networks covering the world,

 all elites,

 operating smoothly,

 just to do this?

 I don't believe you!

Si Wuya knew Ming Shiyin wouldn't believe him,

 he poured Ming Shiyin another cup of water,

 and in a strange tone,

 added to his previous words: "If ten times doesn't work,

 then a hundred times,

 a thousand times.

 A thousand-mile levee is breached by an ant hole; a hundred-foot room,

 burned by a hole's smoke.

After hearing his plan,

 Ming Shiyin was silent for a moment,

 then slapped the table and scoffed: "Now I get it.

 You're more ambitious than I thought.

 Do you think the world is that easy to manipulate?

 Helping Evil Sky Pavilion is just an excuse for your own survival!

Si Wuya shook his head: "I don't have such ambitions.

"If not you,

 then who?

" After asking this,

 Ming Shiyin's mind seemed to jam,

 and the image of that broad figure emerged,

 "Could it be the eldest senior brother?

Si Wuya then interrupted his thoughts.

"If senior brother thinks my method is childish,

 then what superior ideas do you have?

Ming Shiyin fell silent again.

 What brilliant insight could he possibly have?

 If there were any,

 the previous two sieges on Evil Sky Pavilion would not have happened.

At that moment,

 rapid hoofbeats resounded on the streets outside; troops sent to quell the chaos had arrived!

 Ye Zhixing peeked out,

 then bowed and said,

 "Master,

 it's time to leave.

Si Wuya nodded,

 gave Ming Shiyin a meaningful look,

 and said,

 "It's good that the eldest senior brother has such ambition; at least Evil Sky Pavilion won't be besieged like before.

" After saying this,

 Ye Zhixing led him to leap out of the window.

Ming Shiyin picked up his teacup,

 unconsciously nodding,

 "That does make some sense.

" He took a sip of water,

 reflecting,

 "Wait!

 Bringing you back could still implement the plan!

 I've been bamboozled!

 I’ve been spun around!

Realizing something was amiss,

 he quickly jumped out of the window,

 but Si Wuya was nowhere to be seen.

Just then,

 a gray-robed Cultivator appeared: "Mr.

 Fourth,

 there's no need to chase any longer.

 I have never seen the master talk so much with someone else.

 In fact,

 even without an explanation,

 you wouldn't be able to take him away.

" With that,

 he pointed outside.

Suddenly,

 with a "whoosh,

" two four-leaf Avatars appeared.

 Just as Ming Shiyin was unconvinced,

 the two Avatars suddenly merged into one,

 forming a six-leaf,

 and then displayed the Great Supernatural Powers technique and vanished from sight.

Lu Qiuping's eyes widened in awe: "So powerful!

Ming Shiyin turned his head and glared at him: "What are you looking at?

 Keep staring and I’ll gouge your eyeballs out!

Just as he finished speaking,

 a familiar messenger bird crashed into the gray-robed Cultivator at high speed.

 Ming Shiyin raised his hand to remove the letter from the bird and read it: "A flying letter from my junior sister?

 No way,

 Master is going to Divine Capital?

"What is Divine Capital?

 A place teeming with experts,

 where the imperial guards are stationed.

 According to Old Seventh,

 the palace is unifying opinions to deal with Evil Sky Pavilion; isn’t going there like walking into a trap?

 Who gave Master such a foolish idea!

After reading the flying letter,

 Ming Shiyin grabbed Lu Qiuping by the collar and quickly left the place.

 Lu Qiuping pleaded miserably: "Mr.

 Fourth,

 please spare me.

 I can ask my elder brother to return the Precious Zen Robe!

 Let’s talk this over!

Ming Shiyin barked in anger: "Shut up!

Meanwhile,

 in a forest outside Divine Capital,

 Whitezard slowly descended.

 Little Yuan'er jumped down from Whitezard's back: "Master,

 we’re approaching Divine Capital.

 Zhao Yue sister,

 I told you,

 Whitezard is much more comfortable than the Flying Chariot!

Zhao Yue looked somewhat uneasy.

Perhaps because she had just recovered,

 she looked towards the direction of Divine Capital: "Master.

 are we really going to Divine Capital?

Lu Zhou said calmly: "This concerns your origins; we must not be careless.

When the master spoke,

 Zhao Yue naturally dared not say more,

 and the three of them then entered the city.

 One of the most prosperous places in Great Flame is Divine Capital.

 Little Yuan'er had long wanted to visit Divine Capital,

 but unfortunately,

 her master had never taken her there; now that she had the chance,

 she was naturally the happiest.

The bustling architecture,

 orderly streets,

 and the throngs of people far exceeded the trio's expectations.

 Zhao Yue followed Lu Zhou closely and obediently,

 while Little Yuan'er darted restlessly among the stalls.

"Master,

 where are we going?

" Lu Zhou answered: "To Prince Qi's mansion.

Seeing Little Yuan'er's puzzled face,

 Zhao Yue explained: "Someone the master knew from before.

"Someone like master has friends?

Hearing Little Yuan'er's words,

 Zhao Yue couldn't help but laugh and cry.

 Such a remark,

 if made earlier,

 would have surely earned a stern punishment.

 She sneakily glanced at her master and,

 seeing that he wasn't angry,

 she finally felt relieved.

As they walked,

 Lu Zhou stroked his beard: "Yuan'er.

Hearing her master call her,

 Little Yuan'er suddenly knelt down: "Master.

 I was wrong!

 I won't dare again!

Passersby on the street gathered around to watch.

"Why did someone suddenly kneel?

 It's so strange.

" Lu Zhou also showed a puzzled expression: "Why did this girl kneel?

"Get up.

" The onlookers on the street couldn't stand it anymore and,

 after imagining the situation,

 began to scold Lu Zhou.

"How sweet and lovely this girl is,

 how can you be so cold?

"Exactly,

 this girl admits her mistake as soon as she kneels,

 thinking of my worthless child,

 there's really no comparison.

 your grandfather is old and a bit confused,

 I'll buy you a candied haw.

As a group of people chattered nonstop,

 Little Yuan'er angrily stamped on the ground,

 and with a loud boom,

 the ground cracked,

 startling the bystanders into stunned retreat.

"Wow,

 that contrast is a bit scary!

"So fierce!

Little Yuan'er,

 fuming,

 pointed at the people: "Say another word about my grandfather,

 and I'll beat you up!

"Good intentions taken for donkey's liver and lungs,

 why bother meddling?

" The crowd quickly dispersed.

Lu Zhou nodded,

 quite satisfied.

 The performance was quite good; in the past,

 she would talk about killing entire families at the drop of a hat,

 but this time she only mentioned a beating,

 which shows significant improvement.

"Follow.

" Upon hearing their master's command,

 Little Yuan'er and Zhao Yue responded in unison and hurriedly followed behind.

As they passed an intersection,

 Little Yuan'er pointed to several low-level Cultivators and warned: "Master,

 those are people from the Underworld Sect.

 The Underworld Sect is the number one demonic sect in Great Flame,

 avoided by many forces,

 yet they dare to openly recruit here.

 Doesn't the royal family care?

Lu Zhou shook his head and continued walking towards the center of the city: "No need to bother.

Zhao Yue explained to Little Yuan'er: "Indeed,

 the Underworld Sect is considered a demonic sect,

 but for the royal family,

 there's no difference between the Underworld Sect and the top ten righteous sects; they simply do not interfere with each other.

 The Underworld Sect recruiting people is no different from righteous cultivation sects taking in disciples,

 so naturally,

 the royal family wouldn't interfere.

 Besides,

 with the abilities of the great traitor,

 they naturally manage their affairs well.

 It's the same anywhere.

 At least so far,

 the Underworld Sect hasn't openly interfered with the royal family's interests; they have been quietly absorbing other demonic forces,

 which is considered a conflict within the cultivation world.

Soon after,

 the three of them arrived near Prince Qi's mansion.

"Master,

 I'll knock on the door.

" Little Yuan'er was ready to move forward with a clenched fist,

 but before she could act,

 the gate creaked open from the inside.

An elderly butler looked puzzled and asked: "Who are you?

Lu Zhou spoke calmly: "Where is Qin Jun?

The butler was somewhat annoyed,

 wondering who would be so bold as to call the master by his name.

 This butler was not just any butler; he had been at Prince Qi's mansion for twenty years,

 had earned the affection of everyone from top to bottom,

 and was meticulous and thorough in his duties,

 capable of remembering the information,

 preferences,

 and faces of the mansion's important guests—a man skilled at reading people's expressions.

 Squinting his eyes at Lu Zhou,

 his eyes suddenly widened,

 as if he recognized something.

 Not wanting to take any chances,

 he quickly bent his back and hurried forward to greet them.

"May I ask if the old gentleman comes from Golden Court Mountain?

" This emotional intelligence,

 this mind,

 neither offends by misnaming nor uses terms like 'devil' to cause offense.

Lu Zhou strokes his beard and nods: "You recognize this old man?

The old butler,

 without any hesitation,

 kneels down immediately: "This humble one greets the old gentleman!

Beside them,

 Zhao Yue and Little Yuan'er are curious.

 Their master is infamous,

 and many unrelated to the Evil Sky Pavilion avoid him out of fear.

 this butler kneels,

 suggesting a special connection.

Zhao Yue says,

 "Answer the question.

Little Yuan'er nods in agreement: "Answer the question.

The butler explains: "This humble one has seen the old gentleman's portrait in the master's study.

"A portrait of this old man?

" Lu Zhou recalls the first meeting with King Qin Jun,

 not remembering any portrait left behind,

 guessing it must have been commissioned by Qin Jun after his departure.

 it's no big deal.

The butler,

 very adept at handling people,

 knowing the status of such a figure,

 quickly stands up and gestures invitingly: "Old gentleman,

 please inside.

Upon entering the hall,

 the old butler bravely instructs that the best tea from the estate,

 Lake Tea,

 be served as a mark of respect.

Lu Zhou,

 unconcerned about such matters,

 asks: "Where is Qin Jun?

The old butler answers respectfully: "To respond to the old gentleman,

 the master has gone to the imperial city and might return in half a day.

 Please,

 feel at ease to stay,

As soon as he finishes speaking,

 a loud voice from outside announces: "I hear we have a distinguished guest?

The butler turns towards the entrance: "Young master,

 miss.

As the two enter,

 they see Lu Zhou seated in the host's chair,

 a spot not customarily taken by guests.

 Before Qin Shuo can speak,

 the butler quickly reminds him: "Young master,

 do not neglect.

 Even when the master returns,

 respect must be shown.

Qin Shuo nods,

 lowering his proud demeanor: "The junior pays respects to the old gentleman.

But Lu Zhou,

 picking up his tea,

 pays him no mind; after all,

 there is no value in conversing with the inconsequential.

 Qin Shuo notices,

 isn't this his father's beloved Big Red Robe?

 Even with dignitaries from the imperial city at Qin King's estate,

 his father would not lightly offer this long-treasured tea.

At this moment,

 the butler's expression hardens,

 and he steps forward with an inviting gesture: "Young master,

 the old gentleman has traveled far.

 You should withdraw now.

 If you blame me later,

 I will bear it without complaint.

The young lady persuades: "Old Hong has been with father for twenty years,

 longer than either of us.

 If Old Hong says so,

 we must take it seriously.

Qin Shuo nods,

 then bows deeply to Lu Zhou again: "Old gentleman,

 please rest well.

 I will take my leave now.

After the two leave,

 Old Hong returns to the hall: "I have instructed the servants to prepare three top rooms.

 The old gentleman and the two young ladies can rest assured and settle in.

Lu Zhou stands and walks outside,

 looking around,

 and after twenty years,

 he thought things would have changed,

 but it's still the same.

Old Hong nods: "The master has always been nostalgic.

"How is Qin Jun's position in the palace?

Hearing Lu Zhou’s inquiry,

 Old Hong quickly responds: "To speak truthfully,

 the palace is full of intrigue which the master dislikes and stays out of.

 His influence isn’t high,

 but he still holds some sway.

"Do you know Li Yunzhao?

Lu Zhou asks directly.

 Hearing these three words,

 Old Hong's expression changes slightly: "Old gentleman,

 this person is a favorite of the Empress Dowager.

 Although he holds no real power,

 his special status attracts many powerful figures seeking to curry favor; he is indeed a notable person.

Meanwhile,

 Ming Shiyin,

 carrying one of the Five Rats,

 Lu Qiuping,

 flies tiredly: "Master really,

 why go to the Divine Capital at this time?

 It’s so far,

 you have a mount,

 and I have nothing,

 how long will this take?

Lu Qiuping chuckles,

 pleading: "Then just treat me as nothing and let me go.

 I promise to return the Precious Zen Robe immediately.

 You think it's just a Precious Zen Robe?

"Evil Sky Pavilion has so many treasures; why fuss over this one?

 If I die,

 my eldest brother will be angry,

 and my second,

 third,

 and fourth brothers,

 who are far superior in thieving skills,

 will surely seek revenge.

 When will the cycle of vengeance end?

Ming Shiyin speaks gravely: "The mere Five Rats dare to threaten Evil Sky Pavilion?

 Do you know the Precious Zen Robe is my eighth junior brother’s lifesaver?

 Taking the Precious Zen Robe is akin to killing my eighth junior brother.

 Let me tell you plainly,

 the Five Rats are as good as dead in my eyes.

" Hearing this,

 Lu Qiuping's mind goes blank,

 and he faints.

Ming Shiyin glares at him and curses: "Useless!

 Divine Capital is so vast,

 how can I meet the master carrying this useless thing?

 First back to Evil Sky Pavilion,

 then to Divine Capital.

" Thinking this,

 Ming Shiyin grabs Lu Qiuping and flies towards the direction of Evil Sky Pavilion.

Meanwhile,

 next to the Long Wind Tavern in Upper Prime City,

 Upper Prime City has already plunged into utter chaos.

 Four figures dash over rooftops and streets,

After a while,

 the four regroup,

 having found nothing.

"Boss,

 I found this!

 No sign of our fifth brother,

 and Si Wuya isn’t here either.

 I found this,

 our fifth brother's dagger!

The boss takes the dagger and snorts lightly: "So it's you,

 Si Wuya,

 relying on your status as a disciple of Evil Sky Pavilion,

 you think I wouldn't dare to strike?

 Our fifth must have been captured by him.

 I've always warned the fifth to be cautious of Si Wuya,

 this man is extremely cunning and full of schemes.

"Boss,

 we all follow your lead,

 what do we do now?

" The three focus their gaze on their leader.

The boss turns and looks in the direction of Evil Sky Pavilion: "The monk can run but the temple can’t hide.

 If Si Wuya dares to break the rules,

 then we don't need to talk about morality.

 We Upper Prime Five Rats have never pulled off a big job!

 I ask you,

 do you dare to join me in a big heist?

The three show excitement upon hearing this; they've done many petty thefts,

 sneaking around everywhere,

 considered vermin by the righteous.

 People laugh at you as incapable,

 scurrying through streets where everyone shouts to beat you,

 yet they don’t know even a rat can daringly steal the wick from the Buddha’s lamp.

 Comfort breeds a desire for madness,

 many feel this way,

 and the Five Rats are no exception.

 Fortune comes at the risk of danger; who doesn’t covet the treasures of Evil Sky Pavilion,

 especially since they have had experience before?

The four figures dash toward the outskirts of Upper Prime City,

 as evening approaches.

 At Qin King's estate,

 the butler Hong Fu paces like an ant on a hot pan at the front gate.

"Has the master returned?

"Not yet.

 I inquired,

 and it seems the matter is very important; the master cannot leave the imperial city just yet.

"Send someone to urge him again.

The servant helplessly responds: "Butler Hong,

 ordinary people can’t enter,

 and can’t urge.

Old Hong nods and sighs; such matters cannot be forced.

 It's already an achievement for lowly servants to enter the imperial city,

 let alone expect them to contact significant figures inside?

At that moment,

 young master Qin Shuo approaches,

 looks around,

 and comes to Old Hong’s side to ask quietly: "Tell me,

 who is this distinguished guest?

 There’s no one else around now.

Old Hong looks troubled: "Young master,

 it’s not that I don’t want to tell you,

 but this matter is too significant,

 and even if it costs me my life,

 I cannot let Qin King's estate be implicated.

 Please don’t ask any more!

"The more you act like this,

 the more I want to know.

 In this vast Divine Capital,

 I can't think of anyone who would make you so nervous,

 even to the point of using Father's Big Red Robe privately!

 If you can't explain,

 Father will surely punish you.

Hearing this,

 Old Hong gives a wry smile: "Young master,

 I dare stake my life on it,

 the matter is of great importance,

 everything will be clear once the master returns.

"Then I'll wait.

Qin Shuo simply stands beside Old Hong.

 At this moment,

 a carriage appears ahead.

"It's the master returning!

"Father!

Old Hong quickly runs over,

 and a middle-aged man in official robes and a hat steps down from the carriage,

 his gaze falling on the anxious Old Hong.

"Old Hong,

 what's with the fuss?

 You are always steady and meticulous,

 why are you so out of sorts today?

Qin Shuo laughs: "Father,

 a distinguished guest has arrived at the estate,

 and Old Hong used your Big Red Robe to host the guest.

 Isn’t that a cause for urgency?

Qin Jun frowns slightly: "What's going on?

Old Hong approaches Qin Jun and gestures to whisper in his ear.

 Qin Jun leans in to listen,

 and his expression changes abruptly,

 his eyes widening: "Is this true?

" His previously listless spirit suddenly becomes invigorated: "Quickly gather all the direct relatives in the estate!

Seeing his father's panicked look,

 Qin Shuo becomes even more puzzled.

 Even when the Emperor visited,

 his father hadn’t reacted this way; could this person be more formidable than the Emperor?

Soon after,

 all direct relatives of King Qin in the estate rapidly assemble together,

 standing neatly in the large courtyard.

 The madam,

 concubines,

 and the estate's martial experts all look surprised.

"What's going on with the master today?

 Why such a grand arrangement?

"It's said that a distinguished guest has arrived at the estate.

"There's no need for such an elaborate setup,

 It’s too exaggerated.

 I remember the last time we had such a display was when the Emperor himself visited.

This naturally leads to much confusion among everyone.

"Silence!

" Qin Jun's voice reaches everyone's ears,

 "Without my permission,

 no one is to speak.

After giving his orders,

 he turns and leads the way to the courtyard where Lu Zhou is.

 Shortly after,

 he arrives in the courtyard,

 kneels with a thud,

 bows deeply,

 and offers a grand salute: "Qin Jun pays his respects to the old gentleman.

The entire courtyard falls silent,

 unable to understand why the master shows such respect.

"Come in,

 just you alone.

Lu Zhou's voice comes from inside.

 Qin Jun,

 not daring to be careless,

 responds and then waves his hand to those behind him: "Disperse.

Such a grand assembly,

 and without saying anything or giving any reason,

 just disperses at a single command.

 Everyone is baffled,

 but who dares disobey when the master speaks?

After everyone leaves the courtyard,

 Qin Jun respectfully opens the door and approaches Lu Zhou,

 bowing his head to look at the ground: "Junior Qin Jun pays respects to the old gentleman.

Having said that,

 he then glances out of the corner of his eye at the old gentleman standing in the room,

 it's him.

 Even with mental preparation,

 Qin Jun still feels nervous.

 Lu Zhou scans the hanging paintings briefly and loses interest.

"If the old gentleman likes,

 these paintings can be gifts.

Lu Zhou is not interested in these worldly things and shakes his head: "Twenty years have passed,

 how is your cultivation?

Qin Jun honestly replies: "Thanks to the old gentleman's guidance and diligent practice,

 I have barely entered the Divine Court Realm.

 I am honored and surprised by the old gentleman's sudden visit!

 Whatever instructions the old gentleman has,

 I will do my utmost.

Lu Zhou cuts straight to the point: "I am very pleased with your achievements today.

 Do you know Li Yunzhao?

Qin Jun is taken aback: "Yunzhao is a favorite of the Empress Dowager,

 of course I know him.

"Very well,

 have him come to see me.

Qin Jun is taken aback,

 hesitating whether to ask why,

 fearing that asking might offend the old gentleman,

 and is troubled by indecision.

 you can't do it?

Qin Jun quickly bows and replies: "Li Yunzhao has profound and unfathomable skills,

 a rare master in the palace,

 and he generally does not leave the imperial palace under normal circumstances.

Lu Zhou says nothing,

 and Qin Jun realizes his own words might be problematic,

 as only the mediocre constantly look for excuses and reasons.

 He quickly adds: "Please rest assured,

 old gentleman,

 I will definitely bring Li Yunzhao to you.

"If there's nothing else,

 you may go.

Qin Jun hesitates,

 then finally speaks up: "Qin Jun dares to ask the old gentleman a question.

 It is rumored in the cultivation world today that the barrier of Golden Court Mountain is weakening and will collapse within five years.

 Various major cultivation sects are eyeing greedily,

 ready to strike first to seize the treasures of Evil Sky Pavilion; is this true?

Lu Zhou remains silent for a moment,

 then nods: "Indeed,

 that is the case.

Qin Jun exclaims softly: "These so-called righteous cultivation sects are truly despicable.

Lu Zhou did not expect him to speak this way: "The Great Flame royal family wishes for my early demise; aren't you afraid of walls having ears by speaking for me?

"What is there to fear?

 My position today is all thanks to the old gentleman.

 If I were like them,

 wouldn't I be no better than pigs or dogs?

The people of Qin King's estate are each more eloquent than the last.

 And looking at those miscreants,

 which one has the awareness of Qin Jun?

 Unfortunately,

 it's useless with him alone having this attitude,

 especially since Qin Jun is only of the Divine Court Realm.

"The old man merely used you back then; your illness was nothing significant to me.

" Qin Jun is silent for a while,

 then bows with hands clasped: "Within the palace walls,

 who is not using whom?

 Having seen enough of power games and filth,

 I've become numb to it.

"You do see it quite clearly.

"You flatter me,

 old gentleman.

 Please rest well,

 I take my leave.

Lu Zhou waves his hand without saying a word.

As night falls,

 Qin King's estate becomes quiet.

 Lu Zhou takes out the Heavenly Writing,

 just as he begins to study it,

 footsteps suddenly sound from outside.

"Miss Qin Ruobing,

 seeking an audience with the old gentleman.
7|01:39,133|A notification sounded once again.  Ding  Congratulations on reaching the maximum level +30!  Due  to your aptitude reaching the highest level, it has been converted into the following values:  Life  +50,  Energy  +10,  Defense  +10.  Acquired the Latent Being Skill .  Acquired the Night Vision Skill . 
01:39,133|01:48,067|Scene change to the Elf tribe, sounds came from inside the room. Matriarch, I can’t anymore. That’s all for today.  I’ve used up both potions. 
01:48,067|01:52,667|It's such a pain, if I knew it earlier, I would have captured more elves. 
01:52,667|02:02,400|Then she turned to her attendant. Is Cassandra still not back yet? Yes, Matriarch, Cassandra has been gone for a while now. She should have returned by now.
02:02,400|02:09,367|Matriarch, do we need to send someone to check on her? We can also take the opportunity to kill some more Goblins to help the other warriors in the tribe level up?
02:09,367|02:13,267|Yes, send some warriors to the Goblin tribe to support Cassandra.
02:13,267|02:23,000|Suddenly, a voice echoed from outside. Your Cassandra will not be returning today. The elves immediately went on the defensive. Who is it?
02:23,000|02:25,100|An arrow shot out from the darkness. 
02:25,100|02:33,133|It pierced right between the forehead, instantly killing one of them. The Elf Matriarch caught the arrow and was a little scared. Goblin-made?
02:33,133|02:39,233|Lam Thien walked in from the outside. I've captured Cassandra. And very soon, I will have my children with her. 
02:39,233|02:41,367|We're going to be one big happy family.
02:41,367|02:44,833|The Elf Queen immediately pulled out her sword from the wall.
02:44,833|02:49,000|She looked at Lam Thien and said, What have you done to my Cassandra?
02:49,000|02:50,233|What do you think?
02:50,233|03:07,300|Hearing his tone, the enraged Queen charged at Lam Thien.  I will kill you! Lam Thien dodged and said, Your tribe is surrounded. Surrender obediently, and I will treat you well.  The Queen's body trembled, unsure why. My, my body…
03:07,300|03:15,767|Lam Thien explained, I just shot an arrow coated in Goblin venom. Once it comes into contact with you, you’ll quickly become paralyzed. I advise you to be honest. 
03:15,767|03:35,567|The weakened Queen tried to look at Lam Thien. Damn it! Lam Thien sat down and pointed his sword at the Queen's neck.  I heard you talking about leveling up tools, aphrodisiacs… So, the elves have been using Goblins like this for a long time. But I guess you never thought that one day, the Goblins would come to settle the score, did you? 
03:35,567|03:40,367|She thought to herself, Could this Goblin be the new chief Cassandra was talking about?
03:40,367|03:51,867|But below, screams rang out. Kill him! The Queen finally noticed. What’s that sound? Lam Thien said, It seems that time is running out. It seems like…
03:51,867|03:58,433|He dragged her outside to see the scene below. Alright, let's talk about cooperation now.
03:58,433|04:06,267|Below, the elves cried out for help. Help, Matriarch, save us! We don't want to be taken away by the Goblins!
04:06,267|04:16,400|She immediately said to Lam Thien,  What have you done to my tribe? Lam Thien replied, The Goblins are no weaker than the elves now, you have no power to resist.
04:16,400|04:25,033|When the elves were strong, they killed Goblins, now that the Goblins are strong, it's only natural for them to come for revenge. I advise you to face reality, it will be better for you. 
04:25,033|04:33,633|He bent down and threatened her with his knife. I need stronger Goblin warriors, that's why I still need you. As for whether you live or die after I’m done with you, 
04:33,633|04:42,267|That depends on your daughter’s attitude. The scene below was nearing its end. The women were captured, and the men were slaughtered. 
04:42,267|04:53,067|The Queen's heart sank, she was defeated. She knelt down and walked towards Lam Thien. As long as you don't kill my children, as long as they can live, I'll do whatever you want. 
04:53,067|04:55,767|Then she collapsed to the ground, accepting her fate. 
04:55,767|04:59,433|I, I agree to stay and bear children for you.
